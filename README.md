# DiCOVA2021
This is the repository for SMILE lab's submission to the DiCOVA challenge as part of the InterSpeech 2021.

codes/Project.ipynb contains the Jupyter Notebook with the complete code of the project.

The MFCC feature extraction and Posteriors computation requires Kaldi and the pre-trained Aspire model (Link:https://kaldi-asr.org/models/m1). Some shortcut codes used have been put in the codes/Kaldi directory.

Some part of Feature Extraction (Harmonincs and Formants) is in MATLAB. Those files are in codes/matlab folder.

The dataset is part of the DiCOVA challenge, hence must be obtained from the organizers of the challenge.(Link to the challenge:https://dicova2021.github.io/)
